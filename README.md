# ESR
Code to generate satellite data Ecosystem Status Report (ESR) contributions.
This code is modified from Jordan Watson's ESR code from 2021 and earlier, which can be found at https://github.com/jordanwatson/EcosystemStatusReports.

Code is divided into SST-MHW and Chla contributions. Each contribution is further divided by year and ESR region.
